### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in Computer Science working on Automatic Speech Recognition for Nordic languages (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish) with the aim of improving speech technologies for low- and zero-resource languages.

I am passionate about all things related to language: from its origin and evolution to how it's acquired and processed by the human brain, to how machines can be used to enable, assist, and facilitate communication. My research interests are in language and speech technologies inspired by insights from phonetics, phonology, cognitive linguistics, and neuroscience. In my work, I enjoy learning new things, solving challenging tasks, and sharing knowledge and skills with others.
